## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to effectively use Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts.

I improved my ability to write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code by identifying and removing redundant CSS rules and repetitive HTML structures.

I learned how to position lists within layouts in a way that complements the overall design, using properties like margin and padding.

I gained more insight into responsive design techniques, ensuring that the layout adapts smoothly across different screen sizes.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to improve the responsiveness of this project as I learn more about it. My goal is to make the layout look better and work well on more devices and screen sizes.
